Welcome to Listener's documentation!
======================================

Listener is a project to provide a generic voice input
service on Linux desktops  allowing you to dictate text into
most applications. it does not focus on  hands free operation
but rather on reducing the amount of typing required for
tasks such as programming or writing documentation.

The project is still very much technical prototype rather than a
polished voice dictation solution,  but it does produce reasonable
dictation results out of the box.
